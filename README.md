# IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to share that I recently completed my Capstone Project for Data Analysis, which focused on the Stack Overflow Survey 2019. 📊💻

For my project, I analyzed the responses of over 90,000 developers from around the world who participated in the survey. I used Python and a variety of data visualization tools to explore the data and identify key trends and insights.

Some of the questions I asked and answered during my analysis include:

What are the most popular programming languages and technologies among developers today?
How do developer demographics, such as age and gender, influence their preferences and job satisfaction?
What are some of the biggest challenges and opportunities facing the developer community today, and how can we address them?
Overall, I found that Python and JavaScript were the most commonly used programming languages among developers, and that there were significant differences in job satisfaction and career paths based on factors like age, gender, and experience level. By identifying these trends and insights, I hope that my analysis can help inform career decisions and drive positive change in the developer community. 🌟💪
